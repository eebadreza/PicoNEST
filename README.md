## About the Project

The PicoNest project is an Internet of Things (IoT) initiative that explores home automation using Raspberry Pi PICO, HC05 Module, and Voice Recognition. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a smart home system and leveraging IoT technologies.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `assets`: The "assets" folder in the PicoNest project contains static resources and files used to enhance the user interface and overall visual appeal of the home automation system. These assets play a crucial role in providing a seamless and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
- `docs`: The "docs" folder in the PicoNest project serves as a central repository for project documentation, providing valuable information for developers, contributors, and end-users. This collection of documents is designed to aid in understanding, implementing, and extending the functionalities of the PicoNest home automation system. It also consists of files used for Project Submission in the college.
- `src`: The "src" (source) folder is the heart of the PicoNest project, housing all the source code necessary for the implementation of the home automation system. This folder is organized to provide a clear and modular structure, facilitating ease of development, maintenance, and collaboration among project contributors.
- `app`: The "app" folder encompasses the Android application components for the PicoNest Home Automation System. This section provides the APK (Android application package) file along with relevant specifications for the mobile application.
